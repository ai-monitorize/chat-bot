"What is a CPU core?","A CPU core is a single processing unit within a CPU that can execute instructions independently."
"How does multi-threading improve performance?","Multi-threading improves performance by allowing multiple threads to run concurrently, making better use of CPU resources."
"What is system load?","System load is a measure of the amount of computational work that a computer system is performing."
"Why is RAM important for system performance?","RAM is important because it stores data that is actively being used, allowing for quick access and efficient processing."
"What is a deadlock?","A deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release resources."
"How can deadlocks be avoided?","Deadlocks can be avoided by ensuring that resource allocation is managed carefully and by using techniques like resource ordering."
"What is a swap file?","A swap file is a space on a hard drive used as virtual memory when the physical RAM is full."
"What is CPU throttling?","CPU throttling is the process of reducing the clock speed of a CPU to decrease heat generation and save power."
"What is the impact of a slow hard drive on system performance?","A slow hard drive can significantly reduce system performance by causing delays in data retrieval and storage operations."
"How does garbage collection work in programming?","Garbage collection is an automatic memory management process that frees up memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use."
"How do I check CPU usage?","CPU usage represents the percentage of CPU resources used by a process or system."
"What indicates the load on the CPU?","CPU usage represents the percentage of CPU resources used by a process or system."
"How is CPU usage measured?","CPU usage represents the percentage of CPU resources used by a process or system."
"What defines CPU utilization?","CPU usage represents the percentage of CPU resources used by a process or system."
"What happens if the CPU is heavily used?","High CPU usage can cause slow response times and decreased system performance."
"How does CPU overload affect a computer?","High CPU usage can cause slow response times and decreased system performance."
"What are the effects of maximum CPU usage?","High CPU usage can cause slow response times and decreased system performance."
"What problems can arise from high CPU usage?","High CPU usage can cause slow response times and decreased system performance."
